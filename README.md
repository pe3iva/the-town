# The Town
 
## What is "The Town"?

**The Town is a terminal minigame which replicates basic life things you do.** The game is written in C++ and this repository is more of a small prototype of the main game. At least in this prototype, it will be **singleplayer** only, but I might make it multiplayer someday! I am making this for fun and as a project to increase my C++ skills.

## Can I contribute to this project?

**Yes**. Feel free to make your own changes!
